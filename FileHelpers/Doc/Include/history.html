							<ul>
                                <li>DEL: ConverterKind.Custom was removed because it was irrelevant to use custom converters now the library uses [FieldConverter(typeof(YouConverter))]</li>

							<ul>
                                <li>Both DataStorages: SqlServerStorage and AccessStorage completely changed, from now you don't need to override this classes (in fact you can't because are sealed)<br>
                                    You can use these classes as client and provide the callbacks for the Insert and Fill record methods.(<a href="examples.html">check the examples</a>)<li>The FieldQuoted attribute was completely rewritten to support
              optional quote for read, write or both. <br>
              So you need to use now the QuoteMode enum and not only a boolean. (For Excel generated
              CSV files you must use the QuoteMode.OptionalForBoth value) (<a href="examples.html">check
                                            the examples</a>)<li>MOD: DataBaseStorage to DatabaseStorage (Case 
          change)

          ErrorManager. Now it is mandatory to use Errors. 
                                <li>ADD: More and enhanced <a href="testing.html">NUnit tests</a> (more than 260) based
                                    in the coverage of <a href="http://www.cenqua.com">clover.net</a>

                                <li>ADD: Now the wizard supports FieldOptional 
          and IgnoreEmptyLines, also you can generate the properties that map 
          to the fields (useful for Data Binding the RecordClass to any binding 
          aware control in VS2005)

        one of the hardest to implement features.
                                        A lot of effort was put in the usability and in a clear API, if you have any suggestion please post it in the forums =)<br>

          and now has a lot of options to check the classes that you are 
          building, in the future the wizard could help you discovering the 
          record class based on a sample file

	The library has passed his 1st birthday !!! and all thanks to the work and contribution of a lot of people (<a href="credits.html">partial list of  them)</a>
	<br><br>
Too many things were changed, mostly internaly, now we have a performance gain of
        more than 60% in .NET 2.0<br>
        <br>
        I will be releasing the version for .NET 1.1 because I know that a lot of people use
        it in some corporations, but maybe in the next releases the new features will be .net
        2.0 only.  It's a massive job maintain and optimize both =( versions<br>
        <br>
        There are also a lot of major changes, refactoring in the code, and a big
        core rewrite that allow the engines to use less memory and temporary string (we
        are using more buffers to avoid this)<br>
    <br>
        We were very busy to keep to library updated and to give support to the users.  Check the forums for any problems as it's likely they have been addressed here.<br>

          a Close() operation to simplify the API and to make it similar to the

                                            <li>The Read..AsDT methods now create the

          (Thanks Rodolfo Finochietti)

          on SVN, sharing the same files and the build script autodetect your 
          Visual Studio installation. So no more excuses time to get involved =)

							 <li>The write methods are less strict you can 
          pass now an IEnumerable instead of an array, so you can direct pass a

                                                <li>RunTime records can now get a DataTable in

                                                <li>A new constructor overload to the engines 
          that allow to pass the Encoding useful to make the users aware of the 
          Encoding feature. 
                                                <li>FileTransformEngine with two new methods 
          ReadAndTransformRecords and TransformRecords 
                                                <li>Flush method to AsyncEngines to allow users 
          to ensure data is written.  For example, if they are using the library for logging. 
                                                <li>The converters are now smarter as they validate 
          to which types can be assigned and throw exceptions if is wrong (for 
          example if you use ConverterKind.Decimal in a int field) 
          
												<li>The <a href="FileHelpers.ConvertException.html">ConvertException</a> 
          has a lot of context information: LineNumber, ColumnNumber, FieldName. 
          Also better exception messages. 
                                                <li>The integer converters recieve also now a 
          decimal separator to build a InvariantCulture to format and parse the 
          values and strings
                                            </span></li>

											<li>The assemblies are now signed 
          
											<li>The new ConverterBase.DefaultDateTimeFormat 
          to avoid set the converter format field by field =) 
                                            <li>Some error messages from the library were 
          rewritten and now provide more contextual information (line and column 
          numbers, field name, etc). 
                                            <li>ExcelStorage support for more than 26 columns 
          (thanks to Mark Izendooren) 
                                            <li>Encoding support to the CsvEngine

          !!! (I cant belive it, I'm a lazy developer but I know how much worth you get out of tesing the library)
                                            <li>Now you have two versions for the demos, one 
          for each framework version.

	I everyone again !!
	<br><br>
This is a mantenience release but there are some interesting addition and performance improvements
        for .NET 2.0<br>
        <br>
        We are working on some big internal changes to allow move the next features level of the version 3.0, 
        for that we need to rewrite some stream level readers and writers. So, this will be a very busy time<br>
         
		
		<br>We are working very hard to support users.  You can see that our forums are free, but your donations are always welcome via: <br>

                                            <b>Main changes</b>
        <ul>
                                            <li>The error messages have been made more meaningful.  In all exceptions you get; the FieldName, ColumnNumber, LineNumber, etc.
                                            <li>
ADD: FieldIndexers you can now get the values in the AsyncEngine like in the DataReader of ADO.NET =)
     You can access them via index or fieldName (at the moment case sensitive)<br />
This also complete the RunTime records support
